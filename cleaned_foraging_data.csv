- I forage from private property without asking the owner if there is substantial fallen fruit and I have passed the property multiple times and seen no attempt at upkeep. Typically, if I can forage from the ground, I do that first, and occasionally pick directly from plants.
- Sometimes, if a plant looks like it is being upkept, but maybe there is too much demand for the owner or if the item is something that I would really like, I will approach the owner and ask their permission.
- A story: One time I knocked on a door and asked if I could pick some persimmons off a tree that was clearly not being upkept (lots on the ground rotting/squished, lots on the tree about to fall). They said ""Yes! Yes! We do not want them please pick them"", so I did. On another day a week+ later, I came at night with a stepladder to pick some more and the owner came outside by chance, running in to me. They were upset even after understanding that they had given me permission before and restating that they absolutely do not want the fruit. They said I could still take it, but that they were upset. I understand their side of this and that it is better practice to ask each time, but I just feel upset that people are so protective of private property even when they don't want it, etc.",Yes,4,"I am comfortable walking on someone's property, especially when it is somewhat guarded view or the plant is very obviously not upkept for an extended period of time","Harvesting from private trees can reduce waste, save money for the harvester, and save labor time for the owner who would otherwise have to pick up fallen items.

And building the dataset itself is also rewarding; it is interesting to see what trends in species distribution are revealed over time.","I grew up looking forward to american persimmon season every year, and then after college got into wildcrafting meads with them.

The filtering function works great and is a great way to only see species you want to see.,"For what it is, the app is wonderful. I have no issues on the interface as it is. The only thing that could be an improvement is possibly using different color dots for different classifications of plant life. This could allow a better general overview before filtering so foragers can get a general idea of what each spot may contain.","Growth for the platform could be awesome as it could draw more attention to foraging and plant identification, but people should be encouraged to harvest ethically and avoid over harvesting on species where that can become an issue. Potentially having warnings for some species and spots could be beneficial for newcomers.

 It could also be a good idea to potentially create a community where trusted members or those with certain qualifications could verify the accuracy of identifications provided by the general community via a verified or unverified status. The number one rule of foraging is the never consume anything that you can't 100% ID yourself, however some newcomers can ignore this personal responsibility under the initial excitement of learning to forage. While it should still be absolutely stressed how important that rule is, having the ability for experienced foragers to verify identifications could help improve accuracy while also avoiding potentially dangerous misidentifications that can be prevented with inexperienced foragers or those using generic plant identification applications. 

Lastly, potentially creating a platform where foragers could interact more could be a potentially beneficial addition, as it would help stimulate growth and really retain users through a personal sense of community. Being able to organize foraging outages/events could be huge for the platform despite bringing about its own challenges along the way. Increasing engagement is one of the most important methods to grow a platform.","To learn more about the environment and region I live in/am visiting, and to enjoy nature in an enriching a responsible way.",I used to pick blackberries when visiting my grandfather's farm growing up and then largely forgot about the joy of foraging my own berries/food until recently when I discovered how diverse the plant life is around me.
